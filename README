This project is to review ML model codes originally from

# Business problem/question
- Hight/increase (?) diabetic patients readmission rate after undergoing different doses of medications
- Diabetic patients are not equipped well enough in controlingtheir diabetic conditions?
- How data can help improving health conditions of diabetic patients?


# Objective
- To predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted and identify factors contributing to the readmission


# Solution
- Build various ML models using prebuilt PySpark pypeline in Python/Jupiter Notebook
- Content:
            1. Import required libraries
                - Standards libraries
                - Pyspark libraries
            2. Initialize Spark Context
            3. Load the diabetic data
            4. Clean and Pre-process the data
            5. Engineer features in the data
            6. Build ML prediction models
                - Split Data into Training, Validation and Testing
                - Check correlation and select most significant features (for logistic regression)
                - Build Different Classification Models
                    * Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation and Regularization
                    * Random Forest with all features, Cross-Validation and Hyper-parameter tuning
                    * Neural Networks with all features and one hidden layer with 8 neurons
                    * Gradient Boosting with Cross-validation and Hyper-parameter tuning
                - Compare models' performances based on Accuracy and False Negatives
                - Test Gradient Boosting on test dataset
                - Inference and Results
             7. Conclusion
